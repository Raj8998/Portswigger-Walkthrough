# Lab 2

## Using application functionality to exploit insecure deserialization

### Question Description:

We have user access as `wiener:peter` but the lab is vulnerable to unchecked deserialization and also the application in lab has delete user functionality. We have to somehow leverage delete user functionality to delete morale.txt ( File location "/home/carlos/morale.txt" ). As a backup user we have other user credential given as `gregg:rosebud`.

### Tools Used:

- Burp Suite

#### Step 1 [ Find what the HTTP request looks like for deleting an user ]

First of all let's find out where delete account facility actually sends HTTP request.

Login as `gregg` and then in `My account` tab intercept the request when you click on delete button which will look something like below.

#### Step 1 [ Intercept and decode phase ]:

After logging in as wiener intercept the home page and send it to burp repeater ( Check lab 1 if you don't know how to do it. ) and notice the cookie section. Generally our object is encoded with base64 and then encoded with URL encoding which in our case looks like below.
